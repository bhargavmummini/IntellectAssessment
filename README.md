Problem Statement: To create a simple REST application with CURD operations on users.

First of all I have created a basic spring boot application with WebServices Using spring Initializr on https://start.spring.io/.

Later I have done the following the following things

* Designed and created domain Objects required for the application
* Created a Serivce interface with required (create,update,delete) methods to be implemented
* Created a static HashMap for storing user data
* Implemented Service interface and associated methods
* Created unit test cases for testing the service later
* Create REST controller with required URL which consumes JSON and interacts with service layer and then sends back the data to client
* Added validation for checking Names, email and Date of Birth
* Finally tested rest controllers using Postman


Test Results and Postman collection can be found in References Folder
